Please read thru the [overall exercises overview](https://github.com/SENG330/course/blob/master/exercises/Exercises.md).

## Exercise 4
In this exercise we will begin to think about what to do with error conditions in our system, and the possible states our system can be in. You will sketch out the user interface for the observation reporting system and the states it can be in. Since these observations are in the field, we need to ensure our observations can be partially recorded and then reconciled later, when the observer returns to a more stable internet connection.


1. Building on the work from Ex3, correct the code based on the TA feedback. 
2. Let's use the scenario of an experienced biologist observing whale behavior from East Point on Saturna Island
 3.
